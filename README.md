# Whatsapp-Spam
When it comes to web development, JavaScript can do wonders!
Wouldnâ€™t it be cool if we can send infinite WhatsApp messages at just one click? be the first one to wish birthday/anniversaries/special events to our loved ones? schedule any message for any contact/group on your WhatsApp? and so much more?

Well yes, we can achieve all these things with the help of JavaScript.This javascript code spams any whtsapp chat in whatsapp web by creating a spam button and send text to the user N no of times.
